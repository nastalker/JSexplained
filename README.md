## 🧠 Teaching Style

Every file in this repository follows a unique teaching pattern:

1. **Concept introduction**
   Short explanation of what the topic is and why it matters.

2. **Code example**
   Simple, readable example code.

3. **Step-by-step breakdown**
   Comments explaining each line or block of code.

4. **Real-life analogy (if useful)**
   A beginner-friendly explanation to make concepts easier to understand.

This approach ensures that beginners do not just copy code — they *understand it*.
